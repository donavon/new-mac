# Setting up a new Mac

My personal installation script for a new Mac.

To start a new setup, simply run:

```shell
bash -c "`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gricard/new-mac/master/setup.sh`"
```

Note, this sets up an extremely opinionated and highly personalized installation, with my preferences and dotfiles. Please adjust as needed!

TODO
- Screen resolution
- Fix useOptionAsMetaKey setting for Terminal (PlistBuddy not working)
- It'd be nice if there was ever a way to default the green button on windows to use the old behavior instead of going full screen

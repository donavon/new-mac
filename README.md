# Setting up a new Mac

My personal installation script for a new Mac.

Note, this sets up an extremely opinionated and highly personalized installation, with my preferences and dotfiles. Please adjust as needed!

Based on https://github.com/nnja/new-computer

This was created for a 2015 MacBook Pro 13" running macOS 10.14.3

TODO
- Screen resolution
- phpStorm (specific version 2017.1, not latest)
- VS Code settings sync?
